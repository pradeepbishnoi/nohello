# Please, Don't Say Just “Hello” In Chat
Have you ever placed a phone call, said **"Hi"** and the immediately placed the call on hold? The short answer is probably, no. Then why would you start a *Chat* message that way?

## Typical Chat Interaction When Starting With "Hello"
```yaml
2021-08-19 12:32:12 you: Hi
2021-08-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello
...

# CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
2021-08-19 12:34:01 you: I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2021-08-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
```

You're trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you
would do in person or on the phone, but *Chat* is neither of those things. Typing
is much slower than talking. Instead of being polite, you are just making your co-worker wait for you to phrase your question, which equates to lost productivity.

## A Better Way - Give Context with Your Greeting
Leading with a message that includes both a greeting and the context for your message is good for everyone.

```yaml
2021-08-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2021-08-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
```

Following this method has many benefits, chief amongst them being that you get help sooner, while your co-worker does not have to sit watcing a "*you are busy typing...*" message. Doing this, your co-worker can start thinking about their response to your question right away!

Just to be clear, the same goes for the greetings below:
- **"Hello -- Are you there?"**
- **"Hi Bob -- quick question."**
- **"Do you have a sec?"**
- **"yt?"**
- **"ping"**

Just ask the question!

## "But, I'm Being Polite"
If you feel it's brusque to simply say **"Hi"** and ask the question, you can do
something like this:

```yaml
2021-08-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask 
a question.  I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
```

## Conclusion
In the end, asking your question before getting a reply allows asynchronous
communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back,
they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a **"Hello"** and
wondering what they missed.
